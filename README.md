# Responsive-Portfolio-Homework

This Responsive website has been updated to include new work from my most recent projects, updated contact information, resume and working links to reach me through many methods. 

The About page includes a Bio and clickable links in the header and footer (LinkedIn, Instagram, Github, and more)!

The Portfolio page includes 6 of my favorite projects with a link and printable PDF of my resume. The flip tiles are rendered using screenshots from each actual project.  The tiles include clickable buttons to both the Github Repo and live sites.

I used jQuery and set up an API for future email use - I would like to keep updating this page as a working portfolio.

My Linked In, Github profiles have been updated and my Resume with contact information (including phone number) is current.

The portfolio contains a video game, a Resume page, a Timed JavaScript Quiz, a Random Password Generator, my first group project "Purple Pages," and Schedule Day Planner.

Enjoy!
