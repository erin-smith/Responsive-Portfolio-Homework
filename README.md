# Responsive-Portfolio-Homework
This Portfolio website was my first project utilizing Bootstrap.
All links in the Navbar should work, and I added an icon of a latte I made at work, for fun.
Each of the 3 html pages was checked using an html validator.
I used containers, grids, box method, buttons, forms, lists, and responsive Bootstrap syntax.
All pages were checked with viewportemulator.com to try and ensure responsiveness. 
The portfolio contains a video game, a bio-page, a refactor for semantic html project, and the game "Rock, Paper, Scissors".  The other two links are pages that I am not quite finished with yet- but will add soon.
